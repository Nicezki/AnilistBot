  - *Notifications when new episodes are released*\n\
  - *News about your mangas and animes*\n\
  - *Tracking the time you spent watching anime*\n\
  - *Countdown for episodes*\n\
  - *Your own watchlist and readlist*\n\n\
  To receive notifications, just add the anime to your watchlist after searching for it, there's a button for that in the search results.\n\n\
  Any other questions?\n\n\
  Press _Menu_ and see the Guide for more information and settings about this bot."

  *Episodes*\n\
  When new currently airing anime episodes are released, you will be notified about it.\n\n\
  *News*\n\
  When news about your animes are released ‚Äî airing or not ‚Äî, you will be notified. This only works for news in English.\n\n\
  *Specific Cases*\n\
  If you would like to enable or disable notifications to given animes/mangas, you can do that directly via the media in your lists.\n\n\
  Would you really like to disable *ALL* of the __episodes__ and __news__ notifications?"

timeOptions:
  "‚è∞ *TIME*\n\n\
  Change the time for your notifications.\n\n\
  You can do that by setting the time by yourself ‚Äî just remember my clock is in UTC time ‚Äî or send me your location in the user options so I can send you the notifications in your local time."

  Just a calculator of how much time you have passed watching anime.\n\n\
  *User Language*\n\n\
  By default I work with your Telegram language, if not provided my default language is English. If you want to change that, go to the _User_ tab and change this.\n\n\
  *User Location*\n\n\
  _\"WHY ASK ABOUT MY LOCATION???\"_ ‚Äî Everyone\n\n\
  I won't follow you or anything, it's simple: right now I'm running on a server, if you want to change your time for notifications and choose to be notified at 1pm, it will be 1pm in the server's time zone ‚Äî which would be UTC.\n\
  If you want to be notified at 1pm in your local time, I need to know what country you live in.\n\
  You can also set your time in UTC; just as a little reminder, take daylight saving into account (if your country does that).\n\n\
  *Watchlist/Readlist*\n\n\
  To see more info about your anime/manga just press the _More Info_ button.\n\n\
  *Notifications*\n\n\
  Notifications are enabled for all airing animes by default. If you want to disable it open the _User_ tab then click on _Notify_.\n\
  If you want to disable or enable notifications to specific animes, open it in the watchlist and then click on _More Info_.\n\
  Or if you want to set a time of the day when to receive all notifications, click on _Time_ in the _User_ tab."
