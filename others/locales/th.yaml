  *Episodes*\n\
  When new currently airing anime episodes are released, you will be notified about it.\n\n\
  *News*\n\
  When news about your animes are released — airing or not —, you will be notified. This only works for news in English.\n\n\
  *Specific Cases*\n\
  If you would like to enable or disable notifications to given animes/mangas, you can do that directly via the media in your lists.\n\n\
  Would you really like to disable *ALL* of the __episodes__ and __news__ notifications?"

timeOptions:
  "⏰ *TIME*\n\n\
  Change the time for your notifications.\n\n\
  You can do that by setting the time by yourself — just remember my clock is in UTC time — or send me your location in the user options so I can send you the notifications in your local time."

  By default I work with your Telegram language, if not provided my default language is English. If you want to change that, go to the _User_ tab and change this.\n\n\
  *User Location*\n\n\
  _\"WHY ASK ABOUT MY LOCATION???\"_ — Everyone\n\n\
  I won't follow you or anything, it's simple: right now I'm running on a server, if you want to change your time for notifications and choose to be notified at 1pm, it will be 1pm in the server's time zone — which would be UTC.\n\
  If you want to be notified at 1pm in your local time, I need to know what country you live in.\n\
  You can also set your time in UTC; just as a little reminder, take daylight saving into account (if your country does that).\n\n\
